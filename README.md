Scrollkey
=============

Scroll pages vertically (down and up) and horizontally (left and right) in VIM style, using j and k shortcuts.

Due to technical limitations, Scrollkey does not work on:
- about: pages
- addons.mozilla.org
- error pages

## Features
* Some websites already register j and k shortcuts. Therefore, these alternative shortcuts are included:
    * scroll down: shift+j, alt+j
    * scroll up: shift+k, alt+k
* Change the scroll amount to anything you like.
* In the Scrollkey preferences you can set custom values for normal (j, k), shift (shift+j, shift+k) and alt (alt+j, alt+k).
* Use the normal scroll value as the scroll value for PageUp and PageDown.
* Change the scrolling method from vertical to horizontal for a shortcut
